Heroku Deployment Plan Overview
1. Database Setup
* Heroku PostgreSQL Add-on: Added a PostgreSQL database to your Heroku app
* Database URL Configuration: Set up DATABASE_URL environment variable pointing to Heroku's PostgreSQL instance
* Database Connection String: postgres://u3mtq06f068nk2:p79905f18fadcf57bf55114d9b121db27dcb3c1c378960d96575b7f8b1487d5aa@c18qegamsgjut6.cluster-czrs8kj4isg7.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/d778m1njt5t9mt
2. Application Configuration Files
Procfile Creation:
* Created Procfile with: web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 1200 --keep-alive 5 app:app
* This tells Heroku how to run your application using Gunicorn WSGI server
Runtime Specification:
* Created runtime.txt specifying Python version: python-3.11.9
* Ensures Heroku uses the correct Python version
Dependencies Management:
* requirements.txt contains all necessary packages including:
    * Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Werkzeug
    * Gunicorn for production server
    * psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL connectivity
    * Additional packages for your specific functionality
3. Environment Variables & Configuration
Database Configuration Script (setup_heroku_db.sh):
* Sets DATABASE_URL for production
* Configures individual database components (host, name, user, port, password)
* Generates secure SESSION_SECRET
* Sets FLASK_ENV="production"
* Includes database connection testing
Environment Detection (in app.py):
* Automatic environment detection based on Heroku-specific variables (DYNO, PORT)
* Safety validation to prevent production database access in development
* Database URL switching between development and production
4. Application Entry Point
* Main Application: app:app structure where the Flask app is accessible
* Production Configuration: Environment-specific config loading
* Database Connection: SQLAlchemy configured for PostgreSQL
5. Production Optimizations
Gunicorn Configuration:
* Production WSGI server instead of Flask's development server
* Configured for 1 worker initially (scalable)
* Extended timeout (1200 seconds) for long-running operations
* Keep-alive connections for better performance
WebSocket Support:
* Flask-SocketIO integration for real-time features
* Engineio server configuration for WebSocket connections
* Real-time progress tracking for file uploads
6. Deployment Process Steps
1. Code Preparation: Ensured all files are ready for production
2. Heroku App Creation: Created Heroku application instance
3. Database Provisioning: Added PostgreSQL add-on to Heroku app
4. Environment Variables: Configured all necessary environment variables
5. Git Deployment: Pushed code to Heroku's Git repository
6. Build Process: Heroku automatically installs dependencies from requirements.txt
7. Application Start: Heroku starts the app using the Procfile command
7. Production Features Implemented
Security Enhancements:
* Environment-based configuration separation
* Secure session management
* Database connection safety validation
Monitoring & Logging:
* Application logging for debugging
* Database connection monitoring
* Error handling and reporting
8. Deployment Configuration Summary
The deployment uses:
* Platform: Heroku
* Runtime: Python 3.11.9
* Database: PostgreSQL (Heroku managed)
* Web Server: Gunicorn
* Port Binding: Dynamic port assignment via $PORT variable
* Process Type: Single web dyno initially
* Environment: Production mode with proper safety checks
